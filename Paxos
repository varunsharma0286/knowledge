#This document contains notes about Paxos protocol
Paxos is a protocol for achieving a "consensus" in distributed systems.

Assumptions:
Network:
	* Network is asynchronous (i.e. msg losses and delays)
	* Msgs can be lost/duplicated but no corruption (i.e. TCP)
Processes:
	* Processes can crash
	* Processes are non-byzantine (only crash-stop)
	* Processes have permanent stop
	* Processes can propose values
Goal:
Every process agrees on a value from the set of proposed values



Roles of a process (aka PAL):
1) Proposer: 
	processes which proposes values
2) Acceptor: 
	processes that accepts values. Accept meaning it is "considering" that  	value. 
	Majority acceptance = value chosen
3) Learner
	processes that learns the outcome (i.e. chosen value)
